    <div class="intro">
    <p> Writing letters to others - friends, strangers, even yourself - it's always a fun thing to do! But that's not always easy. Having to get supplies, stamps, the whole mailing process.. There's just too many small complications which can make it all seem tiring. Rather than a form of self-expression and fun, it can end up feeling like a chore because of all of this. <br>
        That's why LETTERBOX is here! It's a way to be able to write and send letters, all with the ease of doing it online. </p>
</div>

<div class="about"> <!-- paragraph under intro -->
    <p> LETTERBOX is a website with the purpose of writing letters to whoever you want, and if you want, sharing them with other people too!

LETTERBOX is a place where we aim to allow people to share all their thoughts and feelings - those unspoken words that linger in your mind. Your stories are safe with us!
